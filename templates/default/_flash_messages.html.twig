   This is a template fragment designed to be included in other templates
   See https://symfony.com/doc/current/book/templating.html#including-other-templates

   A common practice to better distinguish between templates and fragments is to
   prefix fragments with an underscore. That's why this template is called
   '_flash_messages.html.twig' instead of 'flash_messages.html.twig'

 Note that for proper FOS HTTPCache usage where you'd typically want to cache everything
 also for logged in users, we will also need to change flash messages to not use sessions:
